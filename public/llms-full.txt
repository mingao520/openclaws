# OpenClaw 101 — Complete Guide

> Free 7-day tutorial to master OpenClaw — build your own AI personal assistant from scratch.

## About

OpenClaw 101 (https://openclaw101.dev) is the definitive learning resource for OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent framework formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. The site provides a comprehensive, structured 7-day tutorial that takes you from complete beginner to running your own fully-functional AI personal assistant.

OpenClaw enables you to build a self-hosted AI assistant that runs 24/7 on your own server. Unlike cloud-only AI chatbots, an OpenClaw assistant has real capabilities: it can read and send emails via Gmail, manage your Google Calendar, browse the web with a real browser, execute code, automate repetitive tasks, and connect to dozens of services through its extensible skills system.

The framework is built on Node.js and supports multiple AI model providers including Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, and any model available through OpenRouter.

Available in both English and Chinese (中文).

## FAQ

- Q: What is OpenClaw?
  A: OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent framework that lets you build a self-hosted personal AI assistant. It connects to services like Telegram, Gmail, Google Calendar, and web browsers, and can execute code, automate tasks, and manage your digital life 24/7. It was formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot.

- Q: Is OpenClaw free to use?
  A: Yes, OpenClaw is fully open-source (MIT license) and free to use. The only costs are: (1) AI model API usage (e.g., Anthropic Claude API costs ~$3-15/month depending on usage), and (2) server hosting (~$5-20/month for a basic VPS).

- Q: How do I install OpenClaw?
  A: You need a Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended), Node.js 20+, and an API key for your chosen AI model. Clone the repository, run the setup wizard, configure your Telegram bot token, and start the gateway. The complete guide is in Day 2 of the tutorial.

- Q: What AI models does OpenClaw support?
  A: OpenClaw supports multiple providers: Anthropic Claude (recommended, best for agentic tasks), OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, and any model available through OpenRouter. You can switch models per-session or per-task.

- Q: What can an OpenClaw assistant do?
  A: Capabilities include: email management (Gmail), calendar scheduling (Google Calendar), real web browsing (Chrome via Browser Relay), code writing and execution, SEO analysis (Google Search Console, Google Analytics), content creation, social media management, file organization, automated monitoring, PDF/document parsing, text-to-speech, image analysis, and more through 100+ community skills.

- Q: What is the difference between OpenClaw and ChatGPT?
  A: ChatGPT is a conversational AI that runs in OpenAI's cloud. OpenClaw is a framework for building your own AI agent that runs on your server, with persistent memory, real tool access (email, browser, code execution), proactive automation (heartbeats, cron), and full customization. Think of it as: ChatGPT is a chat app; OpenClaw is a personal AI employee.

- Q: How much does it cost to run an OpenClaw assistant?
  A: Typical costs: Server hosting $5-20/month (Hetzner CAX11 recommended at ~$4/month), AI API costs $3-15/month for moderate usage. Total: roughly $10-35/month for a fully functional 24/7 AI assistant.

- Q: Can I use OpenClaw on Windows or Mac?
  A: Yes, though a Linux server is recommended for 24/7 operation. You can run OpenClaw locally on Mac or Windows for testing. For production use, deploy to a Linux VPS and use the Browser Relay extension to connect your local browser.

- Q: Is my data safe with OpenClaw?
  A: Yes, OpenClaw is self-hosted — your data stays on your server. No data is sent to third parties except the AI model API calls. You control all API keys, credentials, and data storage.

- Q: How do I get help?
  A: Join the community: GitHub Issues for bugs, Discord/Telegram groups for discussion, or check the Resources page for community links.
